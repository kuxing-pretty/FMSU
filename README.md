# FMSU-FS
FMSU-FS: Unsupervised fuzzy multivariate symmetric uncertainty feature selection based on constructing virtual cluster representative

This repo provide the Python source code of FMSU-FS, the fuzzy version of FSVFR, https://github.com/rahmanian/FSVFR. You can view our paper from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165011421002554?via%3Dihub

Before running the algorithm, you should have five folders with following names: Accuracy, Clusters, SU, KNN, and DKNN.
